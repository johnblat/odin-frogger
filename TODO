# Debug UI Enhancements:
	- Frogger unkillable symbol:
		- Context: 
			- In the frogger game, sometimes it is easier to test gameplay by making frogger unkillable so he can jump anywhere without worrying about dying
			- I created a hotkey that will make frogger unkillable (F2), however there is no visual indicator that frogger is unkillable.
			- CTRL + F for "F2" should show u where in the code this is getting toggled
		- What to do:
			- In assets/frogger_sprite_sheet_modified.png, create a new sprite that will be a symbol displayed on screen to represent frogger is unkillable. (we'll refer to it as the Unkillable Symbol)
				- Perhaps copy/paste the skull and crossbones and put a red X or red "NO symbol" (The circle with diaganol line thru it) on top of it, but you can be more creative if you wish
			- When frogger unkillable is toggled, make it so that the Unkillable Symbol appears somewhere on the screen in an unobstrusive place
				- The toggle variable is called `dbg_is_frogger_unkillable`
					- CTRL + F for "dbg_is_frogger_unkillable" to see where it is created and how it is used currently
					- Note: `dbg_` used to prefix variables that are really only used for debugging purposes
